Type your answer for each question here:

What do you understand by the term interpreted language?
Interpreter language: interpreter language is a programming language that goes through an interpreter which converts code we write into a language understood by your computer's processor.  Executes the instructions directly and freely, without compilation of the program into machine-language instructions.

     

2) What is the difference between an interpreter and a compiler?

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN A COMPILER AND AN INTERPRETER

Compiler: 
1. It takes the entire code in a go
2. It generates an intermediate machine code
3.Its highly used by the production team/industry
4.Compiler is used by programming languages like C,C++,C#,JAVA,SCALA.,etc
5.Compiler is faster
6.More efficient
7.Size of the compiler is large
8.Debugging is slow

Interpreter:
1.It takes single line of the code at a time
2.It doesnt generate any intermediate machine code
3.It is generally used by the software development team/environment.
4.Interpreter is used by programming languages like Python,Ruby,PHP,Perl etc 
5.Interpreter is slower
6.Less efficient
7.Size of the interpreter is small
8.Debugging is fast

3) In which language is the Python interpreter written in?
Python interpreter - whose popular/ traditional implementation is called CPython and is written in C.
Other implementations:
Iron python (Python running on .NET)
Jython (Python running on the Java Virtual Machine)
